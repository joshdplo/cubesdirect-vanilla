# CubeMart
A mock e-commerce site built using Node, Express, and ??MongoDB??. This project was created over two weeks in October 2024.

## Why I made CubeMart
I made this project to practice and learn after taking time off from front-end development. Since my time away, I became interested in video editing, which led me to start learning Blender. I wanted to incorporate the new platforms I've been learning with the ones that I have experience in to create someting fun that shows off my core skills and pushes me outside of my front-end comfort zone.

### Process
The process for creating CubeMart wasn't 
1. Planning

### What I Learned from this project

#### Blender

- More about PBR textures

#### Node
- Basic authentication with JWT

#### Front End
- Product image optimization

### TODO Dev
- ~~create initial db seed (random is fine for now)~~
- set up mailtrap for use with nodemailer
- ~~decide on templating engine~~
- add 'reviewer' role to users after a single purchase

### TODO Cleanup
- refine db seed to be realistic (or just create the live database)
- change db to sqlite???
