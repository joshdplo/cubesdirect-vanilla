# CubeMart
A mock e-commerce site built using Node, Express, and MongoDB. This project was created initially over two weeks in October 2024.

## Why I made CubeMart
I made this project to practice and learn. ((something about "this isn't hardcore")). It's been a bit since I've created a substantial project, and since then I've started learning video editing, which led me to start learning Blender. I figured I'd incorporate all of the platforms I'm currently learning with the ones that I have experience in to create someting fun that also shows off my core front-end skills.

### Process
1. Planning
  - 

### TODO Dev
- ~~create initial db seed (random is fine for now)~~
- set up mailtrap for use with nodemailer
- decide on templating engine
- add 'reviewer' role to users after a single purchase

### TODO Cleanup
- refine db seed to be realistic (or just create the live database)
- change db to sqlite
